We had an amazing experience with Nelson, his balloon, and his crew. Because we were off-season, we had the balloon to ourselves, and what a ride it was! Up and over the old city at sunrise, then into the countryside, over an hour aloft, a relatively soft landing in a field, and some champagne to celebrate. All that and excellent company as well.
