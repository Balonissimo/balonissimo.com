A hot air balloon ride over the Evora countryside was the perfect start to the day. Nelson collected us from our accommodation and took us to the balloon. He was calm and very professional which put any slight fears I had to rest. Once we were up I was spellbound...silently moving across the land with panoramic views of the countryside, the cork trees, cattle and sheep. I could have stayed up there forever. Once safely landed we were treated to a glass of Cava and some Belgian waffles....a perfect trip with the ultimate professional. Thank you Nelson and Isis for such a wonderful day
