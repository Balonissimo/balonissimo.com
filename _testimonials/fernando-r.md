I discovered Evora by accident while looking for options to explore Portugal.
It's a place full of History and worth a visit. Along with those historical stops, it also has very beautiful landmarks that look even more special from above.
Flying in a hot air balloon is really amazing and the mix of excitement and tranquility makes the investment worth it.
The staff is super friendly and they speak several languages, which makes the trip more informative.
Unfortunately the flight had to be very early for safety reasons but I would certainly do it again!
