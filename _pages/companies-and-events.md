## What about your own balloon ? 



# Be different ! 

 If you are intrested in your brand on a balloon, to fly your clients or for publicity reason, please contact us. 



People the world over like Hot Air Balloons. Wherever a balloon is in the sky or on the ground it will always draw a crowd of people. Many surveys have shown that up to 100% of those taking part in the survey confirmed that balloons draw their immediate attention compared to much less with any other form of advertising.



Balloons create a tremendous impact and people like to talk about what they have seen.

Once again surveys have shown that the public at large generally agree that balloons are interesting and consequently they want to talk about them. Far more will talk about a balloon with your name on it than say a billboard poster.



## People remember balloons.

Remember the earlier comment about the Nimble balloons. Recent surveys confirm that in countries where balloons are operating most people can remember the name of balloons that they have seen in the sky. Whereas in comparison, very few could remember billboard posters.



## The balloon image gets recorded.

Now imagine your corporate balloon as the worlds biggest bill board or advertising poster. This is what a balloon can be and for sure everyone will remember it. As we have said, statistics have proved that the recall rate for balloon advertising is much greater than any other form of advertising. People always look up when they see a balloon in the sky. Because of its huge size, it is very difficult to miss and because it is in the sky they are surprised yet excited to see it. It draws their immediate attention time and time again. No matter how many balloons people have seen they never seem to loose their fascination. On many occasions people will follow a balloon for long distances just to get a closer look or to take a photograph. How many people do you know who will look at an advertising billboard for more than a few seconds or will tape record a TV advert?



Many many people take photographs and videos of balloons. Whether it is the shear size and colours, their grace of movement or the spirit of adventure, balloons attract attention and people want to record that in photographs to look at time and time again. Look in any greetings card shop and you will see at least one card with a photograph of a balloon on it. Look in holiday company literature and brochures promoting tourist venues. You will see a photograph of a balloon. People like balloon photographs.

Television companies also enjoy the colour and the attraction that balloons have. They love to cover ballooning events where there is the strong combination of balloons and crowds of people.

Imagine the impact your company logo can make using a balloon as an advertising medium. Statistics indicate that compared to other forms of advertising, balloon advertising can work out much more effective with much lower cost per thousand people reached.

Newspaper and magazine editors have a similar interest in balloons and balloon events. These events are regularly reported and recorded with photographs.

However Balloon advertising should not be seen as a replacement for other form of advertising. What it does do is raise awareness of the company, brand or organisation. It has been proved time and time again that other form of advertising benefit greatly when a balloon sponsorship is also used. It should also be noted that balloons would not be normally used for special weekly product promotions. Balloon images are remembered for a long time. This is the tremendous advantage of using this media.
