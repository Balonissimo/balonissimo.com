      Do we land where we took off ?


      In general , no.  We go with the wind .  That's why we have groundcrew and
      the so called Chase-Vehicle. After landing, somewhere in the Alentejo?  We
      bring you back to the city, the take off field or your hotel in our BJ40
      Classic Landcruiser. All part of the Balon√≠ssimo-Experience !

### What if the weather conditions are bad?

If the weather is bad and you are unable to fly on your prefered day, you will receive a 100% refund.

### Who can fly?

A balloon flight is suitable for most people. Obviously, passengers have to be able enough to hop into the basket before take off, but this is normally not a problem for most, as a helping hand is always available!. It is advisable that passengers or any children should be at least 1.20m in height and able to stand for an hour without problems, so as to appreciate the views from the basket. We recomend pregnant women to postpone the flight on another date.

People with a more serious medical condition or that had recent surgery should check with their doctor first to ask if they can do this kind of activities.

### Why is the flight so early?

Flights take place early in the morning to avoid thermal activity, which occurs in normal conditions two and a half to three hours after sunrise. In wintertime we can fly in the end of the afternoon too.

### Will I get cold?

No, you won't. As we fly at favor of the wind, the temperature during the flight is slightly superior to the ambient temperature.

### What should I wear?

Casual clothing suited to time of year. Shoes should be enclosed and flat.

### I have vertigos, will I be afraid to fly or feel bad during the flight?

Vertigos are the result of static electricity accumulation in the body. In the balloon as there is no real engine and no connection to land, there is no way of receiving it. Consequently vertigos simply do not exist.
