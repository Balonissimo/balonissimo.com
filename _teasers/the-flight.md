Even when you are visiting Evora only a few days you can fly with us. We have **free pick-up service** included in the Evora-from-above flight. 

We take off at sunrise,  after **one hour in the air** we find a nice landingspot in the Alentejo.  We pack the balloon, celebrate the flight and get back to the take-off field or your hotel.

The whole adventure takes about 3 to 4 hours.
