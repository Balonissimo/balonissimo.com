We take off at sunrise, the most beautifull part of the day with the best conditions for ballooning.  . After one hour in the air we find a nice landingspot in the fields. The crew arrives with trailer and jeep, we pack the balloon, celebrate the flight and get back to the take-off field or your hotel.
